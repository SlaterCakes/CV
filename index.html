          Throughout my career, I've worked in telecommunications, hospitality, and bus driving, to name a few. I've always been self-motivated, even when I was a kid and set up a confectionary round selling goods door to door, to having two paper rounds, one in the morning and one in the evening. I've always been interested in the computer science and wish I had learned programming sooner, but I ended up spending more time playing games than creating them. As I've grown older and moved into more office settings, I've discovered that formula creation is both necessary and interesting. Despite the fact that I am by no means an expert, I believe myself capable of handling most day-to-day questions. I'm now learning to code in HTML as a foundation, preferring it to SQL as I want to be a full stack developer. I understand that statement may not be in the proper context, but I will rectify it as my language skills develops, as I currently associate SQL to greater data management and organisation. I want to study full stack languages and eventually like to switch careers and develop apps and websites with the goal of making something genuinely valuable in the real world. There are so many elements of my current role which I believe would benefit from system and application improvements and understanding them better myself makes the process of improving more effieient.
